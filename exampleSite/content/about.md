Pursuing online opportunities is like job hunting. You want to look for jobs or opportunities that you have done in the past. Individuals with more experience can make more money. When you find an opportunity, it's time to go to work. You need to set a schedule, figure out when you want
to work, then get to work. Find out how I got started internet entrepreneurship.

## How Did I Start

Everyone has to start somewhere. Since I did not understand marketing or how to begin, I wanted a simple explanation. I wanted to find a proven system that explained marketing and how to earn capital.

I knew that there were two ways that average people were becoming millionaires. The first way was real estate. With real estate, it takes money to make money. If you don’t have a lump sum of money, you’ll need good credit. I had neither of these commodities.

After endless days and nights of frustration, I found a website called PPC. The site said I could make money every time someone visited my website. All I needed to pay for was a domain name and a hosting plan. There was something about this site that alerted me it would be a
breakthrough.

I initially start searching for internet opportunities in the summer of 2004. At first, I was nervous and skeptical. However, after research I realized this was legit, I joined in and essentially took my first step towards financial freedom.

Upon further investigation, I continuously came across websites that advertised "opportunities to make money online free". However, every time I visited these sites, I always found a fee attached after I went through the sign-up process. Of course, these websites kept the fees
concealed until the end.

### Find Legitimate Opportunities Online

In 2008, I started my first website and named it freelegitmoney.com. I wanted to show my readers legitimate online opportunities, unlike the misleading information I discovered earlier. Even more, I wanted to show people ways to earn passive income online with no start up fees. So I dug in to identify [ways to make money online free](/blog/ways-to-make-money). After months of research, I found several ways to generate income online free. I then showcased all these opportunities on my website. Initially, I monetized my site through advertisements and affiliate programs to generate revenue. It took a few years to get my online venture functioning well. Honestly, I was earning a few hundred dollars per month in the second year. In the third year, I was earning around $800 U.S. dollars per month solely from advertisements. I have been generating revenue online for over a decade now.

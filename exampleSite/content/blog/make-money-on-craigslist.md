The ad is your primary tool to attract buyers. Make your title catchy yet descriptive, such as “Gently Used iPhone 12 - Great Condition.” In the body, be honest about the item’s condition and include keywords that potential buyers might search for.

### 2. Take Great Photos for Listings

Photos are one of the first things buyers notice, so make them count. Use natural lighting and clean backgrounds to highlight your item's features. Capture images from different angles and include close-ups of any important details. Great visuals can build trust and attract more serious inquiries.

### 3. Optimize Your Listing for More Views

Refreshing your ad every couple of days keeps it visible at the top of search results. Use strong keywords in your title and description to improve discoverability. Avoid spammy tactics—focus on clarity and relevance instead. The goal is to make your listing easy to find and hard to ignore.

### 4. Find the Best Deals

### 6. Negotiate Prices

Bargaining is part of the game, and it can save you a lot of money. Be respectful, but don’t hesitate to offer a lower price to open the discussion. Sellers usually expect some haggling, especially if the item has been listed for a while. Polite negotiation often leads to better final offers.

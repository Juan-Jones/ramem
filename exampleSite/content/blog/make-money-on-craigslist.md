### 2. Take Great Photos for Listings

Photos can make or break your listing. Use natural light and a clean background to make your item stand out. Take multiple photos from different angles and highlight any special features.

### 3. Optimize Your Listing for More Views

To get more views, repost your listing every few days. Craigslist sorts by date, so keeping your ad fresh will keep it at the top of the search results.

### 4. Find the Best Deals

Use the search function effectively by setting up alerts for items you’re interested in. Keywords like “moving sale,” “urgent sale,” or “must sell” often indicate sellers willing to negotiate lower prices.

### 5. Use Craigslist for Thrift Shopping

Thrift shopping on Craigslist can yield high returns. Items like vintage furniture, collectibles, and branded clothing can be bought cheaply and resold at a profit.

Craigslist allows you to set up email alerts for specific search terms. This way, you’ll be notified as soon as an item you’re interested in is posted, giving you a head start over other buyers.

Negotiation is key to getting the best deals. Be polite but firm. Start by offering 10-20% less than the asking price and be prepared to meet in the middle.

People who post ads saying do not contact them by email are losing potential buyers. Imagine the number of people who may not even own a cell phone or landline. Cell phones are important to have because nine times out of ten you will have to meet someone at a specific location to make a purchase.

### 17. Find Free Items to Resell

The most profitable product you can sell is something you didn’t buy. To sell are free products. Marketing products that are free yields one hundred percent return. Take advantage of the free section under the for sale column. You never know when you will get lucky. Junk to some people may not be junk to you. Sometimes people give away 42 inches Sony televisions because owners upgrade their home entertainment system. You can turn around and sell these free items!

### 18. Start Flipping Merchandise

Buy products for cheap, then sell your products at a higher price. You can easily find places in your city that offer discounted goods. These are places like garage sales and flea markets.

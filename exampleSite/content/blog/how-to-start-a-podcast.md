## How to Start a Podcast Step-by-Step

Launching an online radio show is much more than recording digital audio files. You must understand the fundamentals of starting a business. More importantly, how to monetize a recorded show; that way you can earn a passive income from your content. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to start an internet show:

### 1. Identify Your Concept, Goals and Vision

The first step to starting your pod series involves devising a plan. For starters, you can use the 5 W’s who, what, when, why, where for planning. Who is your audience? What is your platform about? When are you planning to launch your talk show? Why are you launching a recorded show? Where do you picture your platform five years from now? Answering these basic questions will help you identify a concept and a vision for your internet show.

### 2. Planning Your Content

Brainstorm ideas for your digital broadcast topics and format. Consider what sets your streaming audio apart and how you can provide value to your audience. Develop a content strategy that aligns with your goals and resonates with your target listeners.

There are several formats you can use for your platform. The most popular format is the solo talk show, also known as the monologue. One person is the host in this format. Typically, the content for a solo recorded show includes narrative storytelling, niche-related Q & A’s.

The second most popular format is the co-hosted internet show. This type of production involves two compatible individuals that can deliver content on the same subject. Other popular formats include:

- Educational audio shows – Typically, the educational internet show is niche-related. The content teaches the audience about a specific topic.
- Interview series – This recorded show involves interviewing someone from a particular industry actors, professional athletes, influencers, etc.
- News – The news digital broadcast delivers content on a particular topic.
- Scripted fiction – This format is like writing a book, or better yet, listening to a TV, a drama series.
- Scripted non-fiction – These actual life storytelling episodes require much research. Usually, the format focuses on one theme throughout a series.

### 3. Set up Dedicated Recording Space

Choose a quiet, low-traffic area in your home to set up a space solely for recording. Invest in sound-absorbing materials like foam panels or heavy curtains to reduce background noise and echo. A stable desk, comfortable chair, and proper mic setup will improve your comfort and sound quality. Creating a professional environment helps ensure every episode sounds polished and consistent.

### 4. Name Your Podcast

There are a few options you can use to name your pod series. The first and most popular option is to include keywords in the title. So if your internet show is about cooking, you could name your platform “The Cooking Show”. The second option is to choose a catchy phrase, something that the audience will remember. Last but not least, you could use your name. However, this would not be a good idea unless you already have a social media following.

### 5. Purchase Podcasts Hosting Plan

If, this is your first digital broadcast, I recommend purchasing a podcast hosting plan. The most common question most beginners have is ‘how do I know which web hosting company to pick’? Well, research podcast hosting platforms that meet your needs in terms of features, pricing, and scalability. Compare options based on factors like analytics, distribution, and ease of use to find the right fit for your pod series. Web Hosting can get expensive. Therefore, you should search for inexpensive companies that can host your platform like Bluehost, Google, or WordPress.

### 6. Get a Domain Name

It is advised to simultaneously get a domain name and Web Hosting plan. For the simple fact, most companies will give you a discount when you purchase bundle packages. I recommend sites like Web.com" and Google Domains. These companies are not only renowned but also offer cost-effective solutions.

You’ll need the proper gear to develop a professional sound to communicate with your audience. Using quality equipment is essential because it produces better sound and visuals. However, you don't need to break yourself in the process. You can find inexpensive gear online. Hence, establish a [equipment budget for your podcast](/blog/podcasting-equipment-budget/).

Balance educational, entertaining, and actionable content to keep listeners engaged.

### 9. Choosing your Title

It’s recommended to choose a title on subjects that interest you so you can have fun. In addition, choose a title on a subject you have knowledge about. Include keywords in your title for search engine optimization purposes. But more importantly, you need a title that contains power words, emotional words, or uncommon words. That way you can increase your click-through rate CTR.

### 10. Create a Podcast Description

The podcast description should summarize your title. Keep SEO in mind when writing your description. Hence, remember to include keywords in your description. That way, you can let search engines know what your content is about.

After you create your description, you’ll need to create a cover. Your cover is crucial. It will be the first thing people see when they visit your platform. If you are inexperienced in graphic design, it is advised to pay a professional to create your cover.

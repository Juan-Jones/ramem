## What is Dropshipping?

Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn’t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the seller doesn't have to handle the product directly.

- Wide Product Selection: You can offer a wide variety of products without having to buy them in advance.
- Scalability: With the right tools and strategies, scaling your business is relatively straightforward.

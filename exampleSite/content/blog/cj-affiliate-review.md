## How Do You Get Paid?

Getting paid through CJ Affiliate is a straightforward process once you've earned commissions from your affiliate marketing efforts. Payments are typically made via direct deposit (ACH) to your bank account or through paper check, depending on your preference and location.

CJ Affiliate operates on a monthly payout schedule, ensuring publishers receive their commissions regularly. Payments are typically made around the 20th of each month, covering transactions from the previous month. For example, earnings accumulated in January will be paid out around February 20th. This consistent schedule allows publishers to predict their income and manage their finances more efficiently.

CJ offers multiple payment methods to accommodate its global network of publishers. These methods include direct deposit, checks, and wire transfers. Direct deposit is the most popular option due to its convenience and speed, as funds are transferred directly into the publisher's bank account.
